title: What is gas?
categories: [support]

In Ethereum, "Gas" refers to the fee required in order to conduct a successful transaction.

In return for this fee, Ethereum miners provide the computer power necessary to verify transactions and maintain the network; Throne does not receive a portion of this fee.

It is necessary to have some ETH in your wallet each time you mint an NFT, change the reserve price, or list an item for auction.

The Ethereum network can be congested at times, but developers are working actively to reduce gas fees. Gas prices depend on two factors: how quickly you want the transaction to be processed and how busy the network is at the time of your transaction. You can wait until gas prices go down if they are too high at the moment. In addition, you can submit the price you prefer and wait for the network to process it.

## Why is gas so expensive?
Throne does not control or collect gas fees at all; instead, they are a fee purely associated with the Ethereum blockchain.

During periods of high transaction volume, Ethereum network gas may become expensive. The Ethereum blockchain allows for only a limited number of transactions to be added to each new block. In order to maximize their profits, miners are incentivized to accept transactions at higher gas fees. There is no problem with the Ethereum network if gas fees are high, it's just a function of how it currently operates.
You can choose to accept or refuse to pay a higher gas fee. You have three options when your wallet prompts you to pay for gas, based on the price and the speed you choose. Your transaction will take longer to complete if you pay the lowest gas price-and you may even have it dropped.
To speed up your transaction, you can pay an additional gas fee. If you've submitted a transaction, click the "Speed Up" button in your wallet. This will allow you to resubmit the same transaction for a higher fee, so it can be processed faster.
The cancellation can only be tried when the transaction is still pending. Click "Cancel" to cancel a transaction. A gas fee will still be charged to the network if the transaction is canceled or fails.

## Can I get a refund on gas fees?
No, we cannot issue refunds. Transactions are conducted directly between you and the blockchain through your own wallet, and you should assume full responsibility for your actions.
