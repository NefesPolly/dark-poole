* When an NFT is sold on Throne, either the creator or the collector has the option of completing the transfer of ownership and funds.
* As a collector, once you win an auction, you will be given the option of settling NFT. By clicking the button and paying a gas fee, you can add the NFT to your collection. You should settle the NFT promptly in order to ensure that the creator's wallet is credited with the funds from the sale.
* In the event that a collector has not settled the NFT and you would like to receive the THN or ETH from the sale, you may "Settle Auction." To do so, visit the bids page, and once there, locate the NFT that you wish to be paid for. Click "Settle Auction" on the NFT card, then pay the gas fee to complete the transaction. As soon as the transaction is completed, the NFT will be transferred to the collector and funds will be deposited directly into your wallet.
