# How auctions work


Here's to collecting the most exciting kind of digital art ever: NFTs! In the cryptosphere, NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are one-of-a-kind tokens representing unique goods or assets.

This guide will explain how auctions work on Throne and give you tips for discovering new and upcoming artists.

<br/>
## What kind of NFTs can be found on Throne?
Throne lets you start collecting NFTs from visionary creators and find art that resonates with you.

Get started by exploring [Thr.one](https://thr.one). Keep looking for an artist or piece of art that speaks to you. Take it a step further. You should do as much research as you need to do about the artists' creative practice before you make a decision about which NFT you want to collect.

Learn about the auction process and then place your first bid once you're ready.

<br/>
## I think this might be the place for me. What is the auction process on Throne?
On Throne, NFTs are listed as reserve auctions.

Throne auctions have the following characteristics:
- Creators can choose whether to list their auctions for sale in either ETH or THN.
- *THN* (the Throne token): THN is the utility token of the Throne platform and ecosystem. Throne does not collect any fees, commissions, or royalties for transactions in THN. This means that creators receive 100% of the final price if the work is sold in THN.
- *ETH*: If creators select to sell their work in ETH, Throne will collect a 10% platform fee, resulting in creators receiving 90% of the final sale price.
- All auction interactions on Throne (placing bids, winning and claiming NFTs, etc.) are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.
- *Reserve price:* Creators set a reserve price for the auction and bidders must bid at or above it. The reserve price is made public on Throne. 
- *24 hour countdowns:* Whenever the first bid is placed for an NFT at or above its reserve price, a 24 hour countdown begins on the auction. When the countdown is over, the auction comes to a close. 
- *Time extensions for auctions:* When a bid is placed during the last 15 minutes of an auction, the countdown will be reset to 15 minutes. By extending the auction 15 minutes, each bidder will have a final chance to place a bid, allowing the NFT to attain its true market value. An auction can be extended indefinitely until no other bids are placed within the last 15 minutes of the auction.

## I found an NFT that I want to collect. How do I bid?
Start by connecting your wallet to Throne. Make sure you have enough THN in it to place a bid and enough ETH to pay for gas fees. See [here](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/) for more information about wallets. See [here](https://thr.one/getthn) for how to get THN.

Click on "Place a bid" on the page of the NFT you would like to bid on.

<br/>
When you're the first one to place a bid, your bid must surpass or meet the reserve price. The next bid must exceed the current bid by 10% if the reserve price has already been met. When you place a bid, you'll receive a confirmation if your bid is successful. If your bid is too low, you'll receive an error message.

<br/>
Complete the transaction by confirming it with your wallet and paying a gas fee (for more information on gas fees and how they contribute to Ethereum's operational efficiency, click [here](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/#top)). You’ll need to pay for gas each time you place a bid, or submit any kind of transaction.

Upon completion of the transaction, the funds will be taken from your wallet and locked into a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. Throne is a non-custodial platform. This means we never have access to your funds.

You can add your email address (see ‘Edit profile’ button on your profile page) to receive bid notifications if you haven't done so already. If you click "View on Etherscan," you can see the status of the transaction on the Ethereum blockchain as well.

## I've bid on a few NFTs now. Is it possible to see all of them at once?
You can track the status of your bids by clicking on “Bids” in the upper right corner of any page. On this page, you'll see current and past bids you've placed on Throne. The dashboard will also allow you to place new bids after you're outbid, and settle any NFTs you won in an auction.

## My bid page says I have been outbid. I still want to try and win the NFT, what do I do?
The status of your bids will change on the bids page, and you will be sent an email if you're outbid. Your funds from the original bid will be credited back to your wallet. You can place a higher bid by clicking on "Bid again" if the auction is still live.

You will be asked to approve the new transaction after placing the new bid.

<br/>
## I won the auction! Does the NFT belong to me now?
Once the reserve price is met, the countdown has expired, and you are the highest bidder, congratulations! — you won the auction.

You'll be notified by email if you added your email address to your profile. To make it official, you'll need to settle the NFT, which involves submitting a transaction to the Ethereum blockchain.

## How do I settle the NFT?
Once you win an auction, make sure you settle your NFT. When you settle the NFT, you remove it from escrow and transfer it to your wallet. By doing so, the THN (or ETH) funds will also be released from escrow and sent directly to the creator.

To settle your NFT, click on "Bids" at the top of any page. Choose "settle your NFT" next to the NFT you won. You will be asked to confirm the transaction by your wallet. Once the transaction is confirmed and the gas fee has been paid, the process is complete. By clicking on "View on Etherscan," you can find out what the current status is.

## Where can I share the NFT that I have in my collection?
After settling your NFT, you'll have the opportunity to tweet about the news. Use the "Tweet It" feature to automatically create a tweet announcing your new addition. Tag the creator in your tweet if they're on Twitter -- this is a big moment for both of you!

Create a collector profile and reserve a Throne username if you haven't already. As soon as the NFT is added to your collection, anyone will be able to see it.
