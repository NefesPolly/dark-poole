## We exist to champion the value of digital culture.

An exclusive NFT marketplace for the world's leading creators, brands, and collectors.

Throne has developed an exciting and disruptive technology that will transform our relationship to content and empower content creators like never before.

Exclusivity adds value, that is why we focus on the defining works of the NFT revolution to bring aesthetics on-chain in effort to maintain both the integrity and credibility of the creators we partner with. The importance of technology and contemporary culture is reflected in everything we do, and we have clearly set ourselves apart as a vibrant force in the market because of it.

Selected creators can list for auction their works while collectors from around the world can purchase, make offers, and bid on digital assets in the form of photos, videos, audio, as a non-fungible token (NFT). NFTs are groundbreaking instruments, they’re unique, provably scarce, liquid, and usable across multiple applications. Just like physical goods, you can do whatever you want with them! But unlike physical goods, they're armed with all the programmability of digital assets.

A core part of our vision is that open protocols like Ethereum and interoperable standards like ERC1155 will enable vibrant new economies where creators and collectors truly own this powerful brand new type of digital item. Because we think open, liquid marketplaces such as Throne will help power these new economies and will allow leading content creators to make the most of their digital platform and content.

We’re an ambitious team that’s committed to building a transformational product. Collectively, our teams have  spent over a decade developing various scaling solutions with the brightest minds in blockchain, exploring the possibilities of crypto, but we’re also creators and artists in our own right.

## Invested in creators

What you do, what you make, and what you share online matters. The digital realm isn’t a secondary space anymore, it’s where we live our lives, and it’s where the future is coming into focus. We need better systems for investing in creative expression, supporting visionary artists, and connecting the internet’s creative community. We’re building Throne to fill that need, using the possibilities of crypto to expand what’s possible for creators and collectors alike.

Throne will allow you to purchase digital assets that aim to push the boundaries of collectibles. Brands, creators and collectors who support them are establishing a new paradigm, and we know that what we build together today will be integral to what comes next.

We’ve only just begun scratching the surface of what NFTs mean for creators. It’s incredible to partner with creatives, brands, innovators, influencers, and rights holders to bring content into the NFT realm.

## What is THN?​

THN is the token for the Throne community, network, and marketplace. It will provide creators and collectors alike a more sensible and sustainable solution by driving forward a new creative economy. All transactions on Throne require the THN token.

The Throne token is the exclusive means of payment on the Throne marketplace enabling collectors to bid and purchase NFTs. The Throne token is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network and allows for execution of smart contracts and for consensus-based transactions. A blockchain system based on the use of tokens, which can be bought, sold, or traded. Ethereum was launched in 2015, and since then it has become one of the driving forces behind the popularity of cryptocurrency. In the Ethereum system, tokens represent a diverse range of digital assets and the ERC-20  has emerged as the technical standard for all smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for token implementation.

As an ERC-20 token, THRONE can function similar, in some respects, to Bitcoin, Litecoin, and any other cryptocurrency; ERC-20 tokens are blockchain-based assets that have value and can be sent and received. The primary difference is that instead of running on their own blockchain, ERC-20 tokens are issued on the Ethereum network. Luckily, because ERC-20 tokens are so popular, there are many different options for wallets, making THRONE accessible and operational to so many people around the world.

By creating our own token ecosystem, we can provide our platform with 0% fees. That means all creators listing their work on Throne will receive 100% of the purchase price, Throne does not take any fees or commissions on bids, or purchases.
